        <p>Jeppe Hein activates the visitor’s relationship to space – turning the spectator into a participant. The viewer sees her/himself reflected in the surface of a neon piece which invites them to ‘PLEASE ENJOY RELAX STEAL DANCE TOUCH FLIRT SMOKE WONDER FEEL MUSE EAT SING LISTEN TALK ASK TOUCH NEON LOOK COMMUNICATE TOUCH EACH OTHER USE CAMERA FLASH.' The dialectical opposition catalyzed by language is echoed in the dissociative sensation of seeing one's own reflection behind instructive "rules" created for our own heeding..</p>
