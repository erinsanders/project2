      <p>"Stolen Dance"

<p>I want you by my side
<br>So that I never feel alone again
<br>They've always been so kind
<br>But now they've brought you away from me
<br>I hope they didn't get your mind
<br>Your heart is too strong, anyway
<br>We need to fetch back the time
<br>They have stolen from us</p>

<p>I want you
<br>We can bring it on the floor
<br>Never danced like this before
<br>We don't talk about it
<br>Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
<br>Stoned in paradise
<br>Shouldn't talk about it</p>

<br>Shouldn't talk about it

<p>Coldest winter for me
<br>No sun is shining anymore
<br>The only thing I feel is pain
<br>Caused by absence of you
<br>Suspense controlling my mind
<br>I cannot find the way out of here</p>

<p>I want you by my side
<br>So that I never feel alone again

<p>I want you
<br>We can bring it on the floor
<br>Never danced like this before
<br>We don't talk about it
<br>Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
<br>Stoned in paradise
<br>Shouldn't talk about it</p>

<br>Shouldn't talk about it

<p>I want you
<br>We can bring it on the floor
<br>Never danced like this before
<br>We don't talk about it
<br>Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
<br>Stoned in paradise
<br>Shouldn't talk about it</p>

<br>Shouldn't talk about it
