      <h1>>American Lake Trail</h1>
        <p>From the trailhead, the trail heads downvalley for a short distance to a trail junction. The trail to the lake takes off at a right angle at the junction. The trail rises steeply, switchbacking for about 1-1/2 miles through an Aspen grove before reaching spruce trees where the trail levels a bit. Continue to a large meadow, stay along the lower side of the meadow, turning southward, and reenter the forest. The trail will rise gently, approximately 1/2 mile before the lake, the trail crosses a rock slide area. The trail arrives near the lake's outlet.</p>
