      <h1>>The Ute</h1>
        <p>Ute Trail (Aspen) is a 2.2 mile out and back trail located near Aspen, Colorado and is rated as moderate. The trail is composed of mostly short switchbacks up the forested mountainside that climb over 1200ft; so may provide additional difficulty to hikers unused to this sort of elevation or climb.</p>
