<br>Flashed Junk Mind

<p>We were young souls 
<br>On the junk-yard
<br>Now we are stunned minds 
<br>Full of junk-goods
<br>But I feel your heartbeat
<br>Just like mine 
<br>I feel your heartbeat
<br>All the time</p>

<p>And we were bound to the city life
<br>Flashlights when we're falling into the night
<br>Focused on what you feel
<br>Just when you were calling her love that day</p>

<p>And we were bound to the city life
